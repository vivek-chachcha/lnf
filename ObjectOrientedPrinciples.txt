OO Principles

1) classes in models such as post, comment only have a single responsibility, which is to represent the fields
that relate to a post and a comment.
2) There s loose coupling ex. bookmarkedpost does not depend on underlying implementation of post, bmpostlist
does not depend on bookmarkedpost.
3) templates used such as basesite allows for extensions (can be put into any other templates)
4) every  method in post, comment are closely relevant to what the models represents, less likely for methods to
 be irrelevant clients that use the classes.
5) calling image_url, description_text etc. allows details to be hidden since usage does not depend on whether 
the data is default or user-submmitted, and data is treated the same either way.
